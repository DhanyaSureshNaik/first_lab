# Lab 1: Demonstrating GitHub Actions

This repository demonstrates the use of **GitHub Actions** to automatically run tests on Python code whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

The project contains a simple Python calculator (`src/calculator.py`) and automated tests using both **Pytest** and **Unittest**. GitHub Actions workflows are configured to run these tests and upload test reports as artifacts.
